# device-run.sh --lldb, one command, breakpoint hit, 2026-10-07

> Historical upstream record: names and local paths were normalized for this Linux Mint fork. This is evidence for the underlying toolchain, not a claim of Mint host validation.

Host jw16 (Arch Linux aarch64), iPhone 15 Pro Max (iPhone16,2) iOS 27.0.1 (24A446) through the
Studio Display hub, Swift 6.4.0 swift.org toolchain, xtool f0a1f90. Started 13:46Z with
`LLDB_CMDS` holding the five LLDB commands below; the app is the `xtool new` template (UO).

```

```

The DDI mount, the RSD tunnel, the phone's Swift runtime (copied once, 6.9 GB, reused) and the
sysroot all came from the script. Full transcript: `session.txt` next to this note on esper at
`~/tmp/apple-dev/jw16-lldb-proof/`. `thread backtrace 5` printed only the idle worker thread
(thread #5 is the selected thread after the stop; the stop was on thread #1).
