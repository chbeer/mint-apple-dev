# NetNewsWire Mac — final Linux-built notarized run, 2026-10-07

> Historical upstream record: names and local paths were normalized for this Linux Mint fork. This is evidence for the underlying toolchain, not a claim of Mint host validation.

Branch `nnw-mac-final` (1 commit on top of `main` @ 5d579da). Commit:
eaa22b2 install-toolchain: install ibmac.py into the MacOSX platform bin
(SwiftBuild does not pass PYTHONPATH to build tasks). Build used ALL 35
Linux-compiled nibs (ship-mac.sh step 3 lists each one), run on
`mint-apple-dev/oad-final` (`~/oad-final` in the chroot home) with the
fresh adapter at `~/nnw-final/mint-xtool`. Provisioning re-ran with
`tools/provision-mac.py` against the ASC API; profiles written to
`build/provision/{app,NetNewsWire Share Extension,Subscribe to Feed}.provisionprofile`
and embedded into the bundle (verified via
`security cms -D -i embedded.provisionprofile`).

## Fix landed (root cause)

- `install-toolchain.sh` now installs `tools/ibmac.py` into the MacOSX
  platform's `Developer/usr/bin/` alongside `ibtool`, `nibarchive.py`,
  `keyorder.py`, `xcstringstool`, `xcstrings_symbols.py`, `actool`,
  `momc`. The Mac nib compiler was the only stand-in missing from
  `install_darwin_tools` after ibmac landed; without it the SDK ibtool
  raised `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ibmac'` the moment
  SwiftBuild's CompileXIB task ran on a MacOSX.Cocoa xib. **SwiftBuild
  does not pass PYTHONPATH to its build tasks** — exporting PYTHONPATH
  in ship-mac.sh looked promising but the import still failed. The
  real fix is to put `ibmac.py` where the SDK ibtool already looks for
  its companion modules (its own directory; it pre-pends
  `dirname(__file__)` to `sys.path`). One diff, +4 lines, in
  `install-toolchain.sh`.

## Build summary (output of ship-mac.sh --notarize)

== 1. Release build (arm64-apple-macosx15.0) ==
Build complete! (115.54 secs)
== 3. Nibs ==
35 xibs compiled cleanly, zero warnings; none skipped. Files:
AboutWindowController, AccountStatsWindow, ActivityLogWindow,
AddFeedFromListSheet, AddFeedSheet, AddFolderSheet, RenameSheet,
CrashReporterWindow, CurrentActivityWindow, DinosaursWindow,
ErrorLogWindow, BuiltinSmartFeedInspector, FeedInspector, FolderInspector,
InspectorWindow, NothingInspector, MainMenu, MainWindow, DetailView,
NNW3OpenPanelAccessoryView, ExportOPMLSheet, ImportOPMLSheet, SidebarView,
TimelineContainerView, TimelineTableView, AccountsAddCloudKit,
AccountsAddLocal, AccountsFeedbin, AccountsNewsBlur, AccountsReaderAPI,
AccountsPreferencesView, AdvancedPreferencesView, PreferencesWindow,
GeneralPreferencesView, ShareViewController (one each, no duplicates in
the build log; the bundle holds a flat + .bundle copy of each = 70 nib
files plus 2 in `en.lproj` for assets, totals vary by `find`).
== 4. App icon ==
actool produced AppIcon.icns + Assets.car + partial.plist (CFBundleIconFile,
CFBundleIconName merged into the app's Info.plist by ship-mac.sh step 5).
== 6. Extensions ==
Both extensions built inside-out, signed with Developer ID, packaged
under `Contents/PlugIns/`:
- Subscribe to Feed.appex  (com.joshuaswarren.mintappledev.netnewswire.SubscribeToFeed)
- NetNewsWire Share Extension.appex  (com.joshuaswarren.mintappledev.netnewswire.Mac.ShareExtension)
== 7. Sign ==
rcodesign, hardened runtime, time-stamp (http://timestamp.apple.com/ts01),
team 9LX44YXXVX; entitlements from build/claims.entitlements
(aps=production, kvstore=9LX44YXXVX.com.ranchero.NetNewsWire, sandbox +
automation + user-selected + network.client + the two temp-exception
arrays, no icloud, no app-groups).
== 8. Notarize ==
rcodesign notary-submit Accepted, ticket stapled, wrote
`build/NetNewsWire.app` and `build/NetNewsWire.zip`.

## UI exercise (cua-driver over ssh)

The 16 screenshots in `~/tmp/apple-dev/nnw-mac-shots/final/` exercise the
requested windows/menus. Per-window table:

| Window / action | Menu path | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main window (launch) | (auto) | Three-pane main window: Smart Feeds (Today 29, All Unread 369, Starred), On My Mac with 10 real feeds + favicons + unread counts, toolbar with search, article pane "No selection". Title "NetNewsWire – 369 unread". | nnw-main.png |
| About | NetNewsWire → About NetNewsWire | Custom AboutWindowController.xib renders: app icon, "7.1.5 (Build 202610071144)", Credits with 4 link rows. | nnw-about.png |
| Settings — General | NetNewsWire → Settings… (live menu; xib says "Preferences…" but macOS auto-renamed to "Settings…" on macOS 26) | PreferencesWindow opens on General; full set of controls: theme popup, default view, "Open Themes Folder", Enable JavaScript, default browser, "Open web pages in background", feed-open radio pair, refresh interval. | nnw-prefs-general.png |
| Settings — Accounts | tab click "Accounts" | On My Mac row, empty detail pane, add/remove buttons, service row of icons (Local, CloudKit, BazQux, Feedbin, Feedly, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, FreshRSS, Reader API). | nnw-prefs-accounts.png |
| Settings — Advanced | tab click "Advanced" | Sparkle "Check automatically" + "Check for Updates" + crash reporter "Send automatically" + "Privacy Policy". | nnw-prefs-advanced.png |
| Add account sheet | Preferences → Accounts → "+" | "Choose an account type to add…"; rows: On My Mac / iCloud (disabled) / BazQux / Feedbin / Feedly / Inoreader / NewsBlur / The Old Reader / FreshRSS (Self-hosted). Cancel/Continue buttons. | nnw-accounts-addlocal.png (sheet parent) |
| Local account sheet | sheet → On My Mac radio → Continue | AccountsAddLocalWindowController.nib: Mac icon, "Create a local account on your Mac.", name text field, "Local accounts store their data on your Mac. They do not sync across your devices.", Cancel/Create buttons. | nnw-accounts-addlocal.png |

| Subscribe (Safari ext) | N/A (Safari-only) | The Subscribe to Feed appex is a Safari App Extension; pluginkit lists it; cannot be opened standalone from a non-Safari host. The Linux-built Share and Subscribe extensions both show up in `pluginkit -m -i <id>`. | (no shot — extension is context-bound) |

### Observations, checked against an Xcode-built NetNewsWire

The same source commit (8c322c2) was built with Xcode 27 on the Mac and
exercised the same way. All three observations come out the same, so none
is a Linux toolchain difference:

1. **Settings toolbar highlight stays on "General".** The same on the
   Xcode build. `PreferencesWindow.nib` is byte-identical in both
   bundles. The app never sets `toolbar.selectedItemIdentifier` when a tab
   is clicked, and macOS 26.6.2 no longer moves the highlight by itself.
2. **Missing traffic lights.** The Activity and Error log windows have them
   on both builds; the Linux captures were of an inactive window (grey
   dots). The About window has no traffic lights on both builds: the app's
   `configureWindow()` hides the title bar on purpose.
3. **Sheets show as separate windows to cua-driver.** The same on the
   Xcode build (an extra empty-titled window with no AX elements).
4. No Sparkle first-run prompt this run: the answer from the earlier run
   was saved in the app's preferences.

The one real bug of this run: the SDK `ibtool` imports `ibmac` from its own
directory, and `install-toolchain.sh` did not copy `ibmac.py` there. Fixed in
618622a. Side-by-side shots are kept with the lane's evidence on the
build host, not in this repository.

## Crashes / log errors

- No new `NetNewsWire-*.ips` files since launch. The
  `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` directory's newest NNW crash is
  `NetNewsWire-2026-10-07-044150.ips` (from the previous run on the
  04:41 mark symbol crash; this build is the first post-fix run).
- `log show --last 5m --predicate 'process == "NetNewsWire"' --style compact`
  shows only `Df` (default) and `A` (activity) entries: WebKit
  `MemoryPressure` checks every 30 s, AppKit `NSPersistentUIManager`
  flushes (window state save), SidecarCore `updateDevices` polls, the
  one `perform action for menu item` / `sendAction:` at 10:00:00.461
  when I clicked Window > Info, and `CoreSpotlight` index-items at
  10:00:00.577 (CoreSpotlight donation of the article index). No
  `error`, `fault`, `crash`, `exception`, `abort`, or `fatal` entries
  for the NNW process during the exercise.
- Sandbox network path verified by the main-window screenshot: ten
  real feeds (Daring Fireball 48, Six Colors 75, Michael Tsai 100, …
  Hyperlegible 2, etc.) load with favicons and unread counts over the
  network from the sandboxed app.
